# HomeLab

Merry Christmas to ME!!!! Now that I have completed my Network+ I want to get my hands dirty. I am very familiar with configuring WLAN with my past work experience, but it is time to start exploring. I ordered a Cisco Catalyst 3560X 48-port, A managed switch, online for cheap so I can set up some Vlans and monitor the network in a close environment versus remote like my previous jobs. 

I want to get this LAN network to test my SOC skills as well. I would love to configure a IDS/IPS on this network, it is one of my goals to configure and learn more about IDS/IPS this 2025.
